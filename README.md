# **What is this Repo for?** ü§î

This repository served as my **learning playground** during my early days of delving into **full-stack web development**. I experimented with foundational web technologies, including **PHP, HTML, CSS, JS,** and **SQL**, building a web system from scratch.

With time, advancements in **AI** such as **ChatGPT** and **Phind** have streamlined the self-learning process, allowing me to grasp new technologies more efficiently. This led me to shift my focus from mastering individual programming languages to understanding the systems themselves.

I have since concentrated on more complex projects like my **full-stack web2 and web3 blockchain IPFS integrated app**: [**BuddyFightersNft**](https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/BuddyFighters-FullstackWeb3NFTGame). Though I've moved on from this initial repository, it remains a vital part of my development journey, laying the groundwork for my understanding of full-stack web systems and the main languages that brought them to life.
